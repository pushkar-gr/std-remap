`std::remap` is a C++ image processing tool that creates "image anagrams." It reconstructs a target image using only the pixels from a source image. The core algorithm works by sorting the pixels of both images by luminance, then mapping the source pixels to the target's structure. This results in a unique artistic fusion: a new image that has the color palette and texture of the source, but the recognizable form and shading of the target.
